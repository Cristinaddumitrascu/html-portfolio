        My name is Cristina, and I've been dedicated to the IT industry for nearly a decade. <br>
        I started as someone who loved breaking things, but my journey quickly led me to discover a true passion for building and innovating.<br>

Throughout my career, I've accumulated valuable experience in product management, project management, quality assurance, and UX design (on the side - :D ).<br> 
This diverse skill set has provided me with a deep understanding of how to bring ideas to life and create impactful solutions.<br>

What truly excites me is driving product growth through data-driven strategies and monetization. I relish mastering all aspects of the product lifecycle and leveraging insights to make informed decisions. My ability to bring people together and lead them toward a common goal is one of my greatest strengths and joys.<br> 
I take pride in helping my colleagues grow and succeed, and I'm always ready to roll up my sleeves and work hard to achieve team victories.<br>

If you're looking for someone with a STRONG PASSION for product management, a diverse skill set, and a commitment to team success, I'd love to connect!
